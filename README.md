## Tick Tac Toe Java - CLI
Here is a Tick Tac Toe game using the Java language.
In attempts to learning how to use github, BASH and software development I
decided to create this. I hope to build up this but for simplicity will keep
it to the terminal.

## Install
Simply clone this repo. The files you should get are:
- Main.java
- Game.java
- Board.java
- build (script)
- run (script)

First run the build script as follows:
<code>$ ./build</code>
Note: build accepts an argument "y" which will compile and run the program
Example: <code>$ ./build y</code>
This will create a "classes" folder and place all the .class files within.

You then run the run script as follows:
<code>$ ./run</code>
Note: run does not take any arguments
This will run Main.java and look in the classes folder for the nessesary .class
files.

## Feedback
Feedback is welcomed. I want to improve and what better way for that is to let
everyone provided their feedback.
